## ExpressJS or Express is an essential and moderate web framework of Node.js used for building applications, websites, and backends. 

## CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing .

## Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

## Node.js Connect middleware to sanitize user input coming from POST body, GET queries, and url params. Works with Express, Restify, or any other Connect app.

## nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
